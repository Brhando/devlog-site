# WhileIterating â€“ Game Devlog

This is the public development log for my turn-based RPG being built in Godot.

All posts are written in Markdown and published automatically using GitHub Pages.

## Why I'm doing this
I'm a software engineering student documenting the journey to improve my skills, track my progress, and share with future collaborators and employers.
I've been in love with computers for as long as I can remember, and I thought I had given up on my dream of one day working as a software/computer engineer.
After serving in the Air Force for six years, I took the brave step of transitioning out of the military and going back to school. This fall semester will
be the start of my Junior year, and I wanted to try and use some of the skills I've learned thus far to start a project I've had in mind for awhile.
This game will by no means be where I dream it to be by the end of this summer, but this is a great start.

## My Goals for This Summer and From This Project
- Learn C# and Godot
- Learn the ins and outs of Git and Github
- Create a rough version of a game I can be proud of and one I can continue to polish as time goes on

> P.S. WhileIterating is my handle. Sorry if that is/was confusing. I am still working on transistioning from my old one (Brhando). Also, I thank you for taking the time to read through this. It means a lot to me!

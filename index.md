# 👋 Welcome to My Devlog!

I'm Brandon, a software engineering student and aspiring game developer.  
This devlog documents my journey building a turn-based RPG, with several other game elements mixed in for fun, in Godot.
I post daily devlog entries hoping to catch all of my best "aha" moments, facepalms, and general frustrations.

## Day 4: Scene Transitions, Spawn Points, and Chest Interaction – May 21, 2025

---

### **Progress Made**
- Split the base into two scenes: a **Base Exterior** and a **House Interior**, laying the groundwork for exploration and rest zones.
- Implemented a **scene transition system** using `Area2D` and player input. The player can now move between exterior and interior scenes.
- Created a **global singleton `SceneData.cs`** to persist game state between scenes, currently tracking the active spawn point.
- Set up a **dynamic spawn system**: when entering a new scene, the player is repositioned at a `Node2D` marker whose name is stored in `SceneData`.
- Finalized **chest interaction logic** using `Area2D` and prompt labels. The UI now shows a contextual message when the player is in range.
- Built the foundation for **expandable interactions**, using flags like `PlayerInRange` and smart message prompts.
- Updated and expanded the project’s internal **task list**, clearly separating immediate goals from post-slice polish.

### **Challenges**
- Faced a `Node not found` issue while referencing the HUD label for prompts; solved it by restructuring the node path and verifying the scene tree hierarchy.
- Initially tried to access `SceneData` as if it were a static class, resulting in a "cannot access non-static field" error. Resolved this by referencing the autoload instance directly via `/root/SceneData`.
- Encountered confusion while trying to animate tiles using Godot 4’s TileSet editor. The interface wasn’t intuitive, and attempts to use larger multi-cell tiles as frames failed.

---

### **Next Steps**
- Create a `Workbench` scene and interaction logic using the same `Area2D` framework.
- Start laying out the **initial town area**, including a few placeholder buildings and NPC spawn locations.
- Prototype a **day/night system**, potentially using a `CanvasLayer` + `ColorRect` to simulate lighting changes.
- Begin work on a **persistent inventory system** using `SceneData` or a new autoload singleton.
- Implement **bed interaction** to restore energy and possibly advance time.

### **Reflection**
> This was my most productive day so far. Getting scenes to transition smoothly and setting up spawn logic made the world feel interconnected. The autoload system is proving invaluable—I can already see how it will support more advanced features like inventory and persistent health. Even though the tile animation didn’t work out, I know exactly what to revisit when polish time comes around. The framework is really taking shape, and it feels awesome to see progress stack so tangibly.

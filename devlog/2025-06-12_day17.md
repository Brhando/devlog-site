# 🪵🌿 Devlog Day 17 — Centralizing the Systems (June 12, 2025)

## ✅ Progress Made

- Finished building out the Unified Item Data System:
  - Created `ItemType` enum to cover all item categories I’ll need.
  - Built `ItemData` to handle full item properties: names, stack sizes, icons, prices, and descriptions.
  - Set up `ItemDatabase` as a global singleton where all item data lives.
  - Fully hooked it into my existing inventory, gathering, and merchant systems.
  
- Completed the Merchant Inventory System:
  - Added `MerchantInventory` class to handle individual merchant stock.
  - Built the `MerchantManager` singleton to load and store merchant inventories.
  - Created two example merchants: "Doc" and "Generalist" with appropriate item lists.

- Refactored resource gathering to finally clean up all that duplicate code:
  - Created `HarvestableResource` as a generic base class.
  - Simplified both `Tree` and `Boulder` to inherit from the base class with just 1 line of code.
  - Used exported variables to easily assign resource type, amount, and health directly in the editor.

- Updated Inventory UI to fully connect to the centralized item data:
  - Inventory icons now dynamically load directly from `ItemDatabase`.
  - No more hardcoded icon paths — it's all unified and flexible for expansion now.

- Squashed a small issue with icon loading after updating my singletons (forgot to reload the autoload — classic Godot moment).

## ⚠ Challenges

- Ran into a null reference error when the icons weren’t loading. Turned out to just be me forgetting to reload my updated global.
- Took things a bit lighter today due to poor sleep last night — shifted focus into system cleanup and polish instead of adding new mechanics.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Start work on the Shrine Sacrifice System (third major system that will tie directly into the economy loop).
- Once Shrine is done, I’ll have a functional merchant-shrine-crafting economy to build off of.
- Slowly start migrating any older systems over to the new unified item structure as I revisit them.

## 🧠 Reflection

Even though this was technically a “light” day, I got a lot of important cleanup and architecture work done that’s going to save me headaches down the road. Centralizing item data was one of the best decisions I’ve made so far — it’s already making adding new systems so much smoother. Every piece I refactor like this makes future systems faster to build, easier to debug, and way more maintainable long-term.

Very happy with how much cleaner my codebase is starting to feel.

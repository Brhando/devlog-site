# âœ¨ More Combat Updates â€” Day 13 (June 4, 2025)

## âœ… Progress Made
- Designed and implemented all **prayer buff icons**, dynamically displayed in the UI.
- Wired up the **stored prayer buff activation button** and verified `ApplyBlessing()` works as intended.
- Hooked up and tested all remaining **combat skill buttons** (Slash, Thrust, Block, Prayer, Whirlwind).
- Refactored **skill damage system** using `Func<int> GetDamage`, allowing dynamic buff application.
- Implemented **subclass-specific prayer logic**:
  - Berserker starts with *Mars* â†’ aggressive prayer buffs.
  - Warder starts with *Anicetus* â†’ defensive prayer buffs.
- Developed and integrated **chain logic** for:
  - **Attack Chain**: +5 to all damage types after 3 consecutive attacks.
  - **Defend Chain**: +5 to block value after 3 consecutive blocks.
- Improved **chain effect cleanup and reset logic**:
  - Counters reset after chain activation.
  - Applied effects are tracked via `_buffApplied` and removed on turn reset.
- Added **debug print statements** to verify chain triggers during testing.

## ðŸ§± Challenges
- Damage buffs werenâ€™t applying due to static initialization â€” solved by refactoring to use a delegate system.
- Needed to differentiate prayer progression for subclasses without breaking default class logic â€” solved with `_prayerChanged` gate.
- Ensured all buffs, including temporary chain bonuses, are correctly reset without visual desync.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Implement **enemy AI logic**, including random and strategic skill usage.
- Add **visual indicators** for chain-ready states (glow, text, or icon shift).
- Hook up **boss logic** with multiple combat phases and harder buff management.
- Begin planning **passive unlocks** tied to chain frequency or prayer mastery.

## ðŸ’¬ Reflection
Today was a major leap forward for the heart of my game: **combat mechanics**. Seeing subclass-specific prayer buffs trigger exactly as I imagined was extremely satisfying â€” and the new chain system adds the type of tactical depth Iâ€™ve been hoping for since the beginning.

I feel like Iâ€™m no longer just prototyping â€” Iâ€™m now refining. Each decision today added polish, synergy, and clarity to how the player engages with combat. The fact that buffs now dynamically apply, chains reset intelligently, and UI responds to player inputs means Iâ€™m starting to build a *playable experience*, not just a system.

Itâ€™s also amazing how much smoother development feels now that Iâ€™ve laid strong foundations. The modular design is really paying off â€” I can add, remove, or tweak buffs and skills without unraveling the rest of the game.

One day, someone will play this game and notice the chain buffs kicking in â€” and that moment will feel earned, powerful, and rewarding. Thatâ€™s the experience I want to create. And today brought me one big step closer to it.

## 🏙️ Day 6: Town Scene, Transitions, and Audio Integration – May 23, 2025

---

### **Progress Made**

- Completed the **Town TileMap layout**, including roads, structure, and visual hierarchy.
- Added **player spawn logic** and confirmed position on entering or returning to the scene.
- Implemented **three placeholder NPCs**, laying the groundwork for future dialogue and interaction.
- Created and connected **three interior scenes** for the town buildings.
- Built and integrated **scene transition zones** using `Area2D`, allowing entry with interaction key.
- Resolved a sound issue by delaying the scene transition using a **`Timer` node**, enabling the **door sound** to play fully before switching scenes.
- Learned and applied **C#'s `+=` syntax** for event subscription, improving signal handling and event-driven code.

---

### **Challenges**

- Initially failed to detect the player in `Area2D` zones due to incorrect use of `Name` in signal handlers—fixed by switching to proper reference checking.
- Encountered scene transition cutting off sound—resolved with a timer delay for smoother audio playback.
- Realized that tying a sound effect directly to a scene change function can cause unexpected transitions if reused—will eventually refactor to a **global audio manager singleton**.

---

### **Next Steps**

- **Create a functional Overworld Map** scene that connects Home Base, Resource Area, Town, and Dungeon.
- Add **scene buttons and transitions** to allow navigation between core game areas.
- Begin prototyping a **Crafting Workbench** scene and **placeholder recipe system**.
- Continue working on the **Day/Night cycle** using `CanvasLayer` and `ColorRect` overlay tinting.

### **Reflection**

> While today wasn't as system-heavy as some earlier days, it was deeply satisfying to finish the town and polish scene transitions. Seeing the audio sync smoothly and all the pieces fall into place made the area feel much more alive. I'm especially excited to keep learning about C# events and build out a scalable audio system soon. One more piece of the world is locked in.

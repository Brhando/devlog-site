# 🛏️ Day 8: Day/Night System, UI Time Display, and Icon Redesign – May 27, 2025

## **Progress Made**

- Designed and implemented a **custom Day/Night system** inside the `GameManager` singleton using a 5-stage cycle: Morning, Midmorning, Noon, Afternoon, and Night.
- Configured **time progression logic** to advance only through player travel or sleeping, with dungeon travel forcing nightfall and sleep resetting to morning.
- Added **scene-based tint overlays** using `CanvasLayer` and `ColorRect` to reflect time of day—excluding the overworld map—providing immersive visual feedback.
- Integrated a **time-of-day and day count tracker** into the player UI, styled with orange text and black outline for visibility.
- Connected the **sleep mechanic** to the bed in the home base, limiting usage to Afternoon and Night to prevent time-skipping abuse.
- Redrew and updated the **inventory icons** for wood and stone using custom pixel art for a cleaner, more personalized visual style.
- Pushed all changes and updates to Git for version control.

## **Challenges**

- Ensured tint system modularity and consistency across scenes without affecting UI layout.
- Balanced visual clarity with pixel density when updating resource icons.
- Debugged scene transitions to ensure day/night advancement logic executed consistently across all entry points.

## **Next Steps**

- Begin implementing the **Crafting Workbench** scene and logic, starting with a simple recipe (e.g., 3 Wood → 1 Plank).
- Design and import a **Workbench sprite** to match the newly updated item icons.
- Finalize the inventory system refactor to support **unique item caps and item stacking** (e.g., max 64 stack per resource).
- Continue polishing **UI elements** and feedback for day/night transitions and resource feedback.

## **Reflection**

> Today marked another milestone: the **world now breathes with time**. The shift from static environments to a living, time-responsive space was incredibly satisfying, especially seeing the player UI and tints adapt fluidly. Creating my own pixel art for inventory icons made everything feel more *mine*. Though crafting looms ahead, I’m gaining confidence with each system. I'm proud of the polish and intention behind today’s progress.

# ðŸ“˜ Devlog Day 21 Debuffs â€“ July 1, 2025

## **Progress Made**
- Successfully implemented a **modular debuff system** for both player and enemy entities.
- Created `Debuff`, `DebuffType`, and a global `DebuffData` singleton for managing debuff properties like duration, damage, and effect type.
- Integrated enemy-side debuff logic with `EnemyEntity`, including:
  - Visual glow effects for specific debuffs (e.g., BloodFatigue)
  - Conditional bonus damage via Skull Splitter synergy
  - Per-turn debuff ticking and safe removal
- Hooked debuffs into `CombatManager`, allowing `SkillResult` to apply and resolve them cleanly during combat.
- Fixed potential runtime crash in `TickAllDebuffsDown()` with safe iteration logic.
- Expanded `EnemyManager` to store per-enemy debuff dictionaries and dynamic behavior response.

## **Challenges**
- Had to rethink initial plans for `DebuffData` and `Debuff` â€” lambda-based execution logic felt like overengineering.
- Opted instead for a **data-driven approach**, storing debuff values directly on each instance.
- Original attempt to track debuffs globally in `DebuffData` failed; changed to local dictionaries on both the player and enemies.
- Made multiple rewrites to settle on a system that was both simple and robust.

## **Next Steps**
- Add missing logic for `Disarm`, `Deflect`, and `Immovable Judgement` effects.
- Expand `EnemyEntity` glow or UI indicators for multiple debuffs.
- Begin modularizing `EnemyManager` to reduce bloat and separate concerns (e.g., split out skill pools or enemy templates).
- Eventually allow the player to inspect enemy debuffs with a tooltip or panel UI.

## **Reflection**
Today was a great return to form. After a break, it felt good to dive back in and write everything from scratch with clarity and confidence. The debuff system came together faster than expected, and for once, everything worked on the first go â€” no debugging spirals or wildfires. That alone felt like a major milestone.

The moment of deciding *not* to use lambdas* for debuff behavior was a key reflection point. Itâ€™s a reminder that elegance often lies in simplicity, and systems donâ€™t always need to be maximally abstract to be powerful. Tracking debuffs per-entity instead of globally turned out to be the right call â€” and reinforced the growing maturity of this projectâ€™s architecture.

Even though there's still work ahead â€” especially with `EnemyManager` needing a refactor â€” the overall structure feels more stable, flexible, and future-proof than ever before. Today wasnâ€™t just about adding a feature. It was about leveling up the gameâ€™s design at its core.

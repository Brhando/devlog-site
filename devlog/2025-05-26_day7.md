# 🗺️ Day 7: Overworld Map, Scene Buttons, and Inventory Persistence – May 26, 2025
💡

## **Progress Made**

- Designed and implemented a **functional Overworld Map**, using symbolic icons and buttons to represent Home Base, Town, Resource Area, and Dungeon.
- Created **custom mini-sprites** to distinguish the overworld visually from in-game levels, maintaining asset cohesion while improving clarity.
- Added **scene transition buttons** to the map, linking each location with a corresponding scene using `GetTree().ChangeSceneToFile(...)`.
- Structured transitions using **TextureButtons**, improving readability and interaction feedback.
- Modularized **Area2D portal zones** into a reusable scene for returning to the overworld.
- Used **signals** to cleanly connect the portal’s interaction range with UI display in parent scenes (e.g., PlayerUI).
- Verified **persistent inventory system** successfully maintains player items across scenes.

## **Challenges**

- Initially failed to trigger button presses—traced to a nested class structure that Godot could not instantiate.
- Resolved by flattening class hierarchy and ensuring signal subscriptions were made inside `_Ready()`.
- Faced difficulty connecting `PlayerUI` from inside a modular `Area2D` scene—resolved with custom signals and clean communication between scenes.

## **Next Steps**

- Start prototyping a **Crafting Workbench** and design a **placeholder recipe system** (e.g., 3 Wood → 1 Plank).
- Continue refining the **Day/Night cycle** using `CanvasLayer` and `ColorRect`.
- Add **visual feedback for button hover/click states** on the Overworld Map to improve UX.
- Begin thinking through early **combat polish** and integration with the overworld structure.

## **Reflection**

> This was a shorter workday, but a deeply satisfying one. Building the overworld made the world feel cohesive, and seeing scene transitions working fluidly while keeping inventory intact felt like a major step toward a fully connected experience. I'm proud of the clean architecture used today—especially with reusable scenes and signals—and excited to keep this momentum going.

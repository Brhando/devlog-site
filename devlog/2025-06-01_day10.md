# ⚔️ Day 10 – June 1, 2025

## **Progress Made**
- Built out the structure for combat using singletons:
  - `CombatManager`, `PlayerData`, `EnemyManager`, `PassiveTree`, `SkillData`
- Implemented stamina and action counters in `CombatManager`
- Added chain logic for tracking repeated actions (combo foundation)
- Created `Enemy` and `EnemySkill` classes and sample enemy presets (Goblin, Slime, Skeleton)
- Defined and initialized the basic `Skill` class with:
  - Skill name
  - Cost
  - Delegate for effect execution
- Started working on the Prayer mechanic using an enum and an array to track god cycling
- Set up initial dictionary logic for skills (to be expanded today)
- Pushed everything cleanly to Git

## **Challenges**
- Deciding how to structure `SkillData` and `ExecuteEffect` without overcomplicating early logic
- Prayer cycling logic took some thought—settled on using enums and index tracking, which felt clever in hindsight
- Wanted to create a Buff class but held off for now to stay focused on core loop

## **Next Steps**
- Fill out the `SkillLibrary` with actual skill logic (Slash, Thrust, Block, Prayer, Whirlwind)
- Implement `UseSkill()` and hook it into gameplay
- Create a `ResetTurn()` function for state cleanup
- Begin coding `EnemyTakeTurn()` logic
- Connect prayer cycling to real effects (e.g., god buffs or passive boosts)
- Stub in basic damage/health mechanics

## **Reflection**
Today was less about hammering out endless code and more about **intentionally designing the creative skeleton of my combat system**. I spent a lot of time thinking through how things would interact—how stamina, actions, chains, and prayers could work not just mechanically, but thematically. It felt like I was shaping the soul of the game, not just its logic.

The Prayer system was especially fun to begin shaping. Using an enum and an index tracker felt like a clever and clean way to rotate through gods, each with their own potential buffs. Odin, Mars, Eir, Bastet—all names that I hope will eventually feel iconic within the world I’m building.

There’s a lot left to flesh out, but the core systems are **finally starting to feel modular, expandable, and solid**. I can already picture how I’ll layer in subclasses, unique skill trees, and combo-based strategy. I may not have flashy visuals yet, but the *mind behind the battle* is starting to take form—and that’s more exciting to me than any pixel art right now.

Each day the codebase feels more like a foundation than a mess. It's a structure I trust, and one I'm excited to keep growing.

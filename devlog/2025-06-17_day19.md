# üõ†Ô∏è Day 19 ‚Äì Player Class System & Dungeon Refactor Complete (June 17, 2025)

## ‚úÖ Progress Made
- **Completed Phase 2 Block 2 Refactor**:
  - Modularized `DungeonManager`, `DungeonRoomManager`, and created `DungeonCompletionManager` singleton
  - Added `SceneLoader` and `SceneManager` to abstract and unify scene transitions
  - Introduced `RoomNode` class and `RoomType` enum to handle dungeon room generation in a scalable way
- **Implemented Player Class System**:
  - Created `PlayerClassData` and `PlayerClassType` to represent core and subclass info
  - Added `PlayerClassManager` singleton to dynamically manage player classes
  - Refactored `PlayerData` and `SkillData` to pull class data and skills from `PlayerClassManager`
  - Replaced hardcoded logic with modular class-based behavior
- **Bug Fixes & Improvements**:
  - Resolved `NullReferenceException` in `LoadSkills()` during class setup
  - Fixed an off-by-one indexing bug in skill assignment loop

## üß± Challenges
- A `NullReferenceException` in `LoadSkills()` blocked skill assignment; solved after tracing dictionary access timing
- An off-by-one error in skill assignment caused the wrong skills to be loaded per class; resolved with loop correction

## üîÑ Next Steps
- Implement subclass specialization logic based on combat behavior
- Continue wiring skill unlock logic and progression criteria
- Explore subclass expansion or progression trees to extend player engagement

## ‚ú® Reflection  
Today felt like cleaning up a cluttered workspace ‚Äî not the flashiest part of game development, but definitely one of the most satisfying. Refactoring the class system and fully modularizing the design gave me a lot more confidence in the foundation I‚Äôm building on. It‚Äôs like everything finally clicked into place, and now future systems will be much easier to layer on top.

The highlight was getting the `PlayerClassData` and dynamic skill loading systems working exactly as intended. Writing clean, organized code that behaved properly without any rewrites was a proud moment ‚Äî a clear sign that I‚Äôm growing as a developer. There were a couple of tricky bugs today too, like a `NullReferenceException` and an off-by-one error when loading skills, but I solved them through debugging and logic checks. That kind of problem-solving is becoming more natural with each day I work on this project.

What stood out most was how calm and focused I felt throughout the process. There were no major distractions, and I stayed locked in on the task at hand. Even though the day was mostly behind-the-scenes work, it made a huge difference. The codebase feels cleaner, more reliable, and genuinely enjoyable to work with ‚Äî which is exactly where I want it to be as I move into bigger gameplay systems like subclass specialization.

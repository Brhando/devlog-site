# ðŸ“¦ Day 9: Chest Inventory System, Signal Timing Fixes, and C# Property Insight â€“ May 28, 2025

## **Progress Made**

- Finalized and implemented a **chest inventory system**, allowing item transfer between player and chest inventories.
- Added a **proximity check** to restrict item transfers to the chest unless the player is near it in the home baseâ€”preparing the system for future item-based remote transfers.
- Registered the **chest globally via `GameManager.ActiveChest`**, allowing UI to check proximity cleanly without hard dependencies.
- Refactored `InventorySlot` to use the global chest reference and safely verify `PlayerInRange` before triggering transfers.
- Deep-dived into **signal timing and `CallDeferred()`**, resolving a crash caused by UI updating during active signal chains.
- Gained hands-on experience with **C# auto-properties**, learning how `{ get; set; }` automates encapsulation and private field management.

## **Challenges**

- Debugged a persistent crash involving signal emissions and UI rebuilding, caused by accessing freed nodes mid-frame.
- Investigated the lifecycle of deferred methods and signal-safe scene tree manipulation.
- Balanced architectural cleanliness with practical constraints, e.g. ensuring a single chest works across the whole game.

## **Next Steps**

- Begin implementing the **Crafting Workbench** scene and logic, starting with a simple recipe (e.g., 3 Wood â†’ 1 Plank).
- Finalize **stacking mechanics** to support a max of 64 per item type, and unique item caps.
- Design and integrate a **basic crafting UI** for the workbench interaction flow.
- Continue polishing **inventory interactions**, tooltip handling, and quality-of-life improvements.

## **Reflection**

> Today was a humbling reminder that what *seems* like a simple feature on paperâ€”chest inventoryâ€”can unravel into a web of interconnected systems, timing issues, and architectural decisions. I started the day expecting to breeze through chest functionality, but a series of frustrating crashes quickly forced me to slow down and look under the hood of Godotâ€™s signal system. What started as a UI task became a deep dive into **CallDeferred()**, scene tree stability, and understanding exactly when itâ€™s safe to manipulate the game world. Debugging that issue took hours of poking, reading, testing, and trusting that the solution was there if I just stayed persistent.

> And Iâ€™m glad I did. Solving that crash didnâ€™t just fix a bugâ€”it taught me **how Godot thinks**, how to cooperate with its frame lifecycle, and how to protect my systems from issues I hadnâ€™t even considered before. Then, diving into **C# auto-properties** felt like discovering a secret cheat code for writing cleaner, smarter code. It was one of those rare moments where syntax, understanding, and confidence all clicked into place. 

> By the end of it all, I felt *exhausted*â€”but proud. I didnâ€™t just build a chest inventory system. I built something modular, intuitive, and technically sound. The kind of system I can build upon later, not patchwork my way through. And most importantly, I walked away with a better understanding of how to future-proof my code. Tomorrow, crafting begins. But today? Today, I leveled up.

# üèπ Devlog Day 14 - Dungeon Devlopments (June 5, 2025)

## **Progress Made**
- Fixed issue where Victory button did not reset after clearing a dungeon room.
- Confirmed dungeon progression works smoothly ‚Äî transitions from room to room now reliably reset UI state.
- Solved a visual bug where multiple enemies spawned stacked on top of each other by:
  - Adding `Position1` through `Position4` as child `Node2D`s inside `EnemyContainer`
  - Setting each enemy instance's position to the corresponding node's `Position`
- Confirmed that grouped enemies now display in proper, spaced-out formation.
- Cleaned up scene instancing logic in `EnemyRoom.cs` with a simple position assignment strategy.

## **Challenges**
- Victory button remained visible after proceeding to the next dungeon room. Fixed by resetting `VictoryButtonLock` and calling `UpdateButtons()` on button press.
- Couldn't access `.Position` on `Container` nodes directly ‚Äî resolved by using positioned children instead.
- Enemy click targeting system isn't working as intended ‚Äî will revisit tomorrow with a plan to refactor it using buttons for clarity and reliability.

## **Next Steps**
- Refactor target selection system:
  - Replace current click-to-target logic with dedicated target buttons tied to each enemy.
  - Ensure visual feedback for current target is clear.
- Add visual indicators or outlines for the selected enemy.
- Begin laying groundwork for dynamic enemy groups beyond 4 enemies if needed.
- Investigate ways to animate enemy spawn for added polish.

## **Reflection**
Today felt like a strong systems polish day. I didn‚Äôt introduce any major new systems, but I smoothed out rough edges that were holding the dungeon progression and enemy behavior back. The positioning fix, in particular, was more elegant than hardcoding offsets and will scale better in the long run. It also reminded me that *sometimes the cleanest solution is the simplest one* ‚Äî placing child nodes and referencing their position directly just made sense here.

Getting the dungeon to feel smooth and responsive was a huge step toward making the loop satisfying. I‚Äôm also starting to see the value in all the modular design decisions I made earlier; fixing bugs and adding changes like this feels way more manageable than it did at the beginning. The one annoyance is the target system being unreliable ‚Äî but I have a plan for that tomorrow, and I‚Äôm excited to make it even better.

All in all, this was a solid day of cleanup and quality-of-life improvements. The dungeon feels like a real part of the game now ‚Äî not just a test room. Onward!

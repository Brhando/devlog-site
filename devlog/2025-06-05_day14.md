# üèπ Devlog Day 14 (June 5, 2025)

## **Progress Made**
- Confirmed dungeon system is now fully functional and transitions between rooms cleanly.
- Created and integrated two new singletons:
  - `DungeonManager`: stores and manages `ActiveDungeonEncounters`, a list of enemy data for each room.
  - `DungeonRoomManager`: tracks the current dungeon room index and handles moving to the next room.
- Created dynamic dungeon room flow:
  - Each room is built from a queue of predefined enemy encounters.
  - On victory, the player progresses to the next room with `NextRoom()` and the enemies level up afterward.
- Implemented a clean enemy spawn solution using positioned child `Node2D`s (`Position1`‚Äì`Position4`) in the `EnemyContainer`.
- Enemy entities now appear spaced out properly rather than stacking on top of each other.
- Fixed bug where the Victory button remained visible across dungeon rooms by locking it again and calling `UpdateButtons()`.

## **Challenges**
- Accessing `.Position` directly from a `Container` node isn't valid, which blocked our initial positioning attempt. Resolved by attaching `Node2D`s as children and referencing their positions instead.
- Ensuring the Victory button doesn‚Äôt carry over required a little care ‚Äî had to explicitly reset its visibility and state in the `OnVictoryPressed` logic.
- Targeting system still needs a revamp ‚Äî enemy click-to-select isn‚Äôt always registering reliably.

## **Next Steps**
- Refactor target selection with button-based logic for more consistent behavior.
- Add visual indicators to clearly show which enemy is currently selected.
- Make enemy spawn points more dynamic for flexibility in later dungeons.
- Begin working toward adding new enemy types and combat room types (e.g. traps, mini-bosses).
- Animate enemy spawning and fade-in to improve immersion and feedback.

## **Reflection**
This was a big structure day ‚Äî a lot of today's progress happened behind the scenes but will pay off every time a player enters a dungeon. Building out the `DungeonManager` and `DungeonRoomManager` singletons gives the game a scalable backbone for dungeon encounters and room transitions. They‚Äôre flexible, decoupled from the UI, and pave the way for future features like randomized dungeons, difficulty scaling, and branching paths.

Solving the enemy overlap with a visual node layout approach was a good reminder that not everything has to be code-heavy ‚Äî sometimes the editor and some clean structure are all you need. I‚Äôm also happy with how the dungeon rooms load smoothly now and how simple it is to configure future encounters.

With the core dungeon loop in place and feeling smooth, the game is finally starting to resemble a real RPG experience. Tomorrow‚Äôs goal of improving target selection will polish the flow further, and then it‚Äôll be time to tackle animations, more dynamic encounters, and deeper systems.
